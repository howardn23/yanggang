The live debate begins at 5:00, but we're hoping you'll be able to join in our Debate Watch Party as early as 4:00. Of course, arriving whenever you can works well, too! As an aside, a little bird told me there would not be a Debate Watch Party in Encinitas in December. We hope all will join in here.<br><br>We'll have Happy Hour from 3:00 to 6:00, so we'll have plenty of time to enjoy the special prices on appetizers and drinks. The prices at 19TEN Oceanside are reasonable in any case, so we're good no matter what time you arrive. Of course, purchases are optional. <br><br>We'll have all the televisions and the big screen tuned in to the debate. The excellent integrated sound system will be tuned in, as well. You'll be able to hear and see from wherever you are seated, and we'll have closed captioning on the televisions and the big screen, too! <br> <br>On the Sprinter, exit at the Crouch Street Station. Walk southwest, 725 feet, and cross Oceanside Boulevard. If driving, from the 5 freeway, take exit 52, Oceanside Boulevard. Go east on Oceanside Boulevard, about a half-mile. Turn left into the strip mall, before Taco Bell and just before the Black Rock Coffee Bar kiosk. 19TEN Oceanside has a sign that says Sports Bar and it's deep into the parking lot. We're ADA accessible, with closed captioning on all the televisions. Because 19TEN is a pub, attendees must be 21 and up. <br><br>Come together with your friends, family members, and neighbors for this fun event and cheer for Bernie at the 6th 2020 Presidential Democratic Primary Debate! Get excited about our historic campaign to transform America, and sign up to do the important work of grassroots organizing.<br><br>Of course, we welcome all interested viewers.

The live debate begins at 5:00, but we're hoping you'll be able to join in our Debate Watch Party as early as 4:00. Of course, arriving whenever you can works well, too! As an aside, a little bird told me there would not be a Debate Watch Party in Encinitas in December. We hope all will join in here.<br><br>We'll have Happy Hour from 3:00 to 6:00, so we'll have plenty of time to enjoy the special prices on appetizers and drinks. The prices at 19TEN Oceanside are reasonable in any case, so we're good no matter what time you arrive. Of course, purchases are optional. <br><br>We'll have all the televisions and the big screen tuned in to the debate. The excellent integrated sound system will be tuned in, as well. You'll be able to hear and see from wherever you are seated, and we'll have closed captioning on the televisions and the big screen, too! <br> <br>On the Sprinter, exit at the Crouch Street Station. Walk southwest, 725 feet, and cross Oceanside Boulevard. If driving, from the 5 freeway, take exit 52, Oceanside Boulevard. Go east on Oceanside Boulevard, about a half-mile. Turn left into the strip mall, before Taco Bell and just before the Black Rock Coffee Bar kiosk. 19TEN Oceanside has a sign that says Sports Bar and it's deep into the parking lot. We're ADA accessible, with closed captioning on all the televisions. Because 19TEN is a pub, attendees must be 21 and up. <br><br>Come together with your friends, family members, and neighbors for this fun event and cheer for Bernie at the 6th 2020 Presidential Democratic Primary Debate! Get excited about our historic campaign to transform America, and sign up to do the important work of grassroots organizing.<br><br>Of course, we welcome all interested viewers. Thank you, everybody, for coming out to participate in democracy.",

We have been busy since then.<br>                                                                                                                 <br>We are a growing group of Marion County citizens and voters, running the full spectrum of age and backgrounds who are active in our communities to dump Trump and support Bernie Sanders for President; find and support our local, state and federal progressive candidates campaigning to be elected to our public offices; and to place the following progressive initiatives on the 2020 election ballot. <br><br>PROVIDE MEDICARE FOR ELIGIBLE LOW-INCOME ADULTS [Ballot Initiative Serial # 18-16] <br><br>RAISING FLORIDA\u2019S MINIMUM WAGE ($15 LIVABLE WAGE) [Ballot Initiative Serial # 18-01] <br><br>PROHIBITS POSSESSION OF DEFINED ASSAULT WEAPONS  [ Ballot Initiative Serial # 19-01]<br><br>RIGHT OF ADULTS TO CANNABIS [Ballot Initiative Serial # 15-20]<br><br>These petitions are one of the most effective ways to walk up and interact with local voters \u201ccold\u201d and many participate since the issues and proposed laws are popular with voters to sign.  <br><br>Quite a few voters become new volunteers in our statewide campaign to create positive changes here at home and around Florida.  <br><br>Local and Florida State candidates who support our popular progressive petitions appreciate the support we can offer in turn, using our petitions as \"links\" between voters and progressive candidates in a necessary \u201cdouble round\u201d of elections in 2020 & 2022 to create change.<br><br>A new state law, HB-5, was made effective just after our last 4th of July Independence Day holiday that eviscerates the right of Florida citizens to sign ballot initiative petitions, like these listed here, in order to vote in the next election to approve them.  Several of the most popular, beneficial petition drives were ended due to the changes made by Florida politicians to end our right to petition to vote.  <br><br>This HB-5 law was passed now to stop these petitions and to discourage progressive voters from coming to vote in 2020.  This suppression of the vote will be challenged in federal court by a group, FL CITIZENS RIGHT TO PETITION, which includes several of our Bernie volunteers, here in Marion County, Florida.<br><br>We seek Bernie campaign volunteers, neighborhood canvassers, interested voters and those willing to assist by collecting Florida voter signed \"citizen sponsored\" ballot initiative petitions to place these non-partisan progressive issues on the 2020 election ballot.  We accept the fact and responsibility of winning this election or not and intend to do all we can to make sure we are successful.<br><br>We meet occasionally on a weekly basis in our volunteer member\u2019s homes, local restaurants, and other locales.  <br><br>Our monthly meetings are held on the third Sunday of every month, between 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM in Room \u201cB\u201d of the main Marion County Library, located at 2720 E Silver Springs Blvd, Ocala, FL 34470.  Signs in the library lobby will show you the way to where we are meeting.  Our next scheduled meeting is Sunday, December 15th, 2019 at 1:30 PM.  <br><br>Our permanent \u201cBernie Sanders Volunteer Office\u201d is located at 4315 SE 10th PLACE OCALA, FL. 34471.  We are in a quiet SE residential neighborhood, not far from the intersection of Silver Springs Blvd. (State Road 40 East) & NE 36 Avenue.  <br><br>Please call first, to ensure we are present and available Monday - Saturday unless attending a pre-scheduled appointment, meeting or event.  We are Closed on Sundays unless a special meeting is scheduled. Thank You!<br><br>Please feel free to contact and join us on Facebook, or by our phone or email.",

We have great opportunities for short canvassing events in many locations. We are also planning phonebanking events and road trips to help in early states!  <br><br>Come together with family, friends, and neighbors to talk to voters in your community about the election. We'll be asking folks to share what issues are important to them this election, and telling our stories of why we're supporting Bernie in 2020. Using the BERN app, we will do the critical work of helping the campaign identify who is likely to support Bernie.",

For over 25 years, Lighty has organized, written and spoken on the subject. He is currently a lead policy analyst for a single-payer bill, SB 562, the Healthy California Act. Lighty is the chief healthcare policy advisor for Senator Sanders of Vermont and played a central role in creating the Senator\u2019s Medicare For All Bill in the Senate.  <br><br> <br><br>As with any policy matter during political campaigns, it is the job of campaigns and hopefully, movements, to educate voters on the issues.

Yes, we will talk, canvass, wave signs, and educate our undecided neighbors about the wonderful things that Bernie Sanders will be bringing to the table.  Let's show our community that we are ready for a political revolution. <br><br>Important instructions: We will only stand on the sidewalk that surrounds and covers all 4 sides of the courthouse. Not on the storefront sidewalks, not on the courthouse grass. Only on the sidewalks. We will begin accommodating ourselves on the front sidewalk/corners of the courthouse. Then the front, then sides, then the back if needed. All sides face traffic. Please watch your children well. Bring water and snacks for your kids if needed. There are a few benches for your convenience. There is also a Hardee's walking distance and also a very nice cafe right across the courthouse called Damfino's Cafe. They close at 2 pm on Saturdays. Safety will be your responsibility and priority!<br><br>Wear your Bernie gear, bring official Bernie signs, or make your own! You're welcome to express your creativity. If you do not have any of these, we do count with a limited number of rally signs (those need to be returned to the organizer), and stickers (for you to wear on your top and keep).  Leaders of all faiths, people from all religions, atheists, teachers, refugees, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community are welcome. Everyone is welcome even if you do not reside in Gadsden County. Be ready to explain to new voters, prospective and new Berners why you are supporting Bernie!<br><br>Ideas for your own poster signs:<br>Legalize Marijuana Nationally<br>$15 an hour Bernie 2020<br>25% poverty level compared to a 15% poverty level, let's fix it Bernie 2020<br>\"Housing for All\" Bernie 2020<br>\"Medicare for All\" Bernie 2020<br>Bernie for Diversity and Inclusion<br>Bernie for Criminal Justice Reform<br>Bernie for Public Education Funds<br>Bernie for Teachers - 60k minimum a year<br>Bernie for Climate Change<br>Ban Assault Weapons<br>Bernie for Immigration Reform<br>If you ride Big Bend Transportation, please remember to schedule ahead of time.<br>See you there!",
