Don't feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February.",

SC is the 4th state to hold a caucus or primary so it's imperative we help get Andrew Yang's message out. The science shows the best way to tell people about his message is by a face to face conversation. Join us for a fun afternoon of putting Humanity First and sharing Yang's message in Aiken county. We are meeting at the Democratic Party Headquarters at 410 Richland Ave West at 1:00 and going from there. Be sure to wear your Yang swag if you have some, but I have Yang buttons if you need one.",

The training lasts for about an hour, just select a time slot that works best for you. On the call, you're able to do a few practice phone calls with an Organizer on the line to help if you get stuck. <br><br>Remember we rely on this grassroots effort that you helped create, but we can't just stop at vocalizing support. We have to put in more effort than any other campaign out there, and this is where it all starts!",
