CD-2 and -3 Yangsters may also have a good amount of luck here, so please come out to support us!<br><br>This is the first day of classes in the Spring Semester at Hofstra, which has lots of local students, so I'm excited for the opportunity to collect lots of signatures.<br><br>Feel free to swing by at any time during the 8AM - 8PM window, but would really appreciate if you could spend at least ~2-3 hours helping out the campaign. We'll be busy collecting signatures for the most part, but I'm planning to have down time so we can bake a Yang Gang Hang into this day! :) Let's meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!",

All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

Let's crush these goals and keep this campaign rolling. CD-2 and -3 Yangsters may also have a good amount of luck here, so please come out to support us!<br><br>Feel free to swing by at any time during a 12PM - 9PM window, but would really appreciate if you could spend at least ~3 hours helping out the campaign. We'll be busy collecting signatures, but will surely also have time for some food and bubble tea breaks, so please come out and meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!<br><br>Expecting some good foot traffic this weekend as lots of people will be looking to do Christmas gifts returns and exchanges.",

The idea is to get any exposure to Andrew Yang, as 1000s will be watching lining the parade route: the YangBigHead will be in full attire, jacket, no tie, scarf, lapel pin, plus $1000 YangBucks. A display of  satire and spoof of this campaign centered around mainstream media screwups. See event website for parking information.",

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at Cafe Mokka on Sat. 12/28 @ 3pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be dicussing getting things together to potentially do some tabling or/and yanging at Arts Alive and the Arcata Farmer's Market -both the following weekend! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",
