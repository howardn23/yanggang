We are asking our supporters to take advantage of any time available, however big or small, to spend engaging in conversation with our neighbors in Keene.<br><br>Because we are asking you for your time in this final phase of the election, we want to accommodate you to the best of our ability. The average canvassing shift is between two and three hours. These shifts can be shorter with a friend or partner! Please contact Colleen at (603)-313-8637 or cwillis@peteforamerica.com about getting a canvassing partner. Furthermore, if any of the times listed do not work for you, please get in touch and we can find a time that works for both of us. Thank you!",
