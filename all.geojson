We are asking our supporters to take advantage of any time available, however big or small, to spend engaging in conversation with our neighbors in Keene.<br><br>Because we are asking you for your time in this final phase of the election, we want to accommodate you to the best of our ability. The average canvassing shift is between two and three hours. These shifts can be shorter with a friend or partner! Please contact Colleen at (603)-313-8637 or cwillis@peteforamerica.com about getting a canvassing partner. Furthermore, if any of the times listed do not work for you, please get in touch and we can find a time that works for both of us. Thank you!",

He later worked in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice on education discrimination issues and in the Office of the Pardon Attorney on President Obama\u2019s clemency initiative for non-violent drug offenders. For the 2016 presidential election, he directed the get-out-the-vote operation for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in western PA.<br><br>If you have any accessibility needs, please let us know so that we can make sure the event will be accessible and comfortable for you.

We can also talk about the ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors! This should be a really informal meeting! Don't feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February.",
