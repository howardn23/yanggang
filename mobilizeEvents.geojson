Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. Again, this event will be on the DAY OF THE PRIMARY! Conversations will involve directly convincing people to take time out of their day to go vote, and to vote for Yang. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 8:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner and watch the results roll in. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner. Obviously, a full day's commitment is a hard ask, but it's the only way we can win. Thank you all for your dedication. HUMANITY FIRST!",

We only have one chance to turn out this critical final early state, so come make a difference where it really counts: by having face-to-face conversations with South Carolina voters. We need every single person we can get on the ground, making connections and showing voters that we are real and our movement will not be stopped. Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. We'll be there every weekend day leading up to and on the day of the South Carolina primaries, so please sign up for any and all days you're available. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 9:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner. Obviously, a full day's commitment is a hard ask, but it's the only way we can win. Thank you all for your dedication. HUMANITY FIRST!",

Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. We'll be there every weekend day leading up to and on the day of the South Carolina primaries, so please sign up for any and all days you're available. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 9:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner.

Whatever it's cool, hoping to attract people to look our way and approach us, with free swag and an infectious energy<br>-Our table will be out all day long. To gauge the who and when of volunteering, I have a spreadsheet doc, please put down the time you plan to be there",

We only have one chance to turn out this critical final early state, so come make a difference where it really counts: by having face-to-face conversations with South Carolina voters. We need every single person we can get on the ground, making connections and showing voters that we are real and our movement will not be stopped. Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. We'll be there every weekend day leading up to and on the day of the South Carolina primaries, so please sign up for any and all days you're available. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 9:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner. Obviously, a full day's commitment is a hard ask, but it's the only way we can win. Thank you all for your dedication. HUMANITY FIRST!",

Get a few too!<br>Every NJ Yangster is expected to sign a petition! Get a few too!<br><br>From Doylestown - People can walk the town and collect more signatures and direct people to the event.  Or people can go to NewHope/Jersey/MontCo/Delco etc and return the completed sheets back to a trusted and designated person to get them into Mariana's hands around dinner time. We ask everyone to go to www.yang2020pa.com to review the collection process and if possible, print out the relevant counties you plan on collecting signatures before the event because you can also bring your completed petition forms as well and we will get them where they need to go!<br><br>Everyone is invited. This is great if you have friends/family because there is lots to do for families around town and restaurants and bars to talk it up and get more signatures and voters!! <br><br>If you like the idea but feel it is too far - why not do one near you? We really want people to leave with canvassing in mind to continue the momentum! This is a beautiful workspace BYO  venue for food and drink and is right in the center of town. With a large TV for YangTube, a professional sound system and cobblestone driveway access to encourage walkins! Accessible by train, plane, bus, car and foot. <br><br>Free Parking. Lot's of leisurely foot traffic. <br>Museums, movie theater, shops, restaurants and close to NewHope, PA<br><br>LET'S DO THIS!!!",

We only have one chance to turn out this critical final early state, so come make a difference where it really counts: by having face-to-face conversations with South Carolina voters. We need every single person we can get on the ground, making connections and showing voters that we are real and our movement will not be stopped. Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. We'll be there every weekend day leading up to and on the day of the South Carolina primaries, so please sign up for any and all days you're available. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 9:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner. Obviously, a full day's commitment is a hard ask, but it's the only way we can win. Thank you all for your dedication. HUMANITY FIRST!",

Let\u2019s meet at the Burger King at 16th Street and Thomas in Phoenix, and then let\u2019s knock on some doors!<br><br>Please text me as soon as possible if you are planning on attending, or if you need to cancel. If you can't stay for the whole event, that's fine. Bring stuff from: https://yangprints.com to pass out, if possible.<br><br>Let's get Arizona to join the Yang Gang!!  We will be meeting for dinner after canvassing at the downtown Old Spaghetti Factory for anyone that's interested.  We can talk about how canvassing went and make plans for future events.  :)",

                "Description": "Did you know you can vote early for Yang in Nevada in the county you live in? If you cannot participate in the caucuses for whatever reason, you can still vote for Andrew Yang at one of the early voting sites below on 2/15-2/18. An early vote counts the same as a caucus vote. Many of our supporters may have work or family responsibilities and cannot participate in the caucuses. To help boost voter turnout and help Andrew Yang win, please reach out to friends and family, or people you Yanged and bring them to one of the early voting sites to vote, buddy system! You literally have 4 days to get friends, family, coworkers, church friends, or strangers you Yanged to vote. Better even, host a President's Date party and Yang everyone at the party and bring them to an early voting site to: vote Yang! Let\u2019s see who can bring the most people to vote for Yang! <br><br>Please sign up for the event so we can give you more assistance and directions. Please track and inform us how many people you brought out to vote and for which precinct/county timely at the close of each day so we can get a rough count of early votes each day, and plan where to send more volunteers to increase turnout the next day. Timely reporting is very important. <br><br>Voting sites and hours:<br>https://nvdems.com/early-vote/<br><br>Note: Make sure everyone has a valid Nevada ID. You can register as a Democrat on site if necessary. Early voting is similar to Ranked Choice Voting. You can put up to 5 candidates, of course, Andrew Yang should be the first choice if you are reading this. :) <br>Dedicated Yang Gang should participate in the caucuses to help bring over some undecided people (don\u2019t vote early), but we still need you to get people to vote early.",

There is a resident office dog mascot, though he won't bother you, in case anyone has allergies. <br><br>There are so many ways to help the campaign that I'm sure we can each find something to contribute regularly together.

                "Description": "It's crunch time.<br><br>The South Carolina primaries are on February 29th. We only have one chance to turn out this critical final early state, so come make a difference where it really counts: by having face-to-face conversations with South Carolina voters. We need every single person we can get on the ground, making connections and showing voters that we are real and our movement will not be stopped. Thousands of voters across the country will be making their decision based on Yang's showing in South Carolina, and they are in dire need of canvassers.<br><br>This is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to help the campaign. It's doing what you already do: sharing your passion for Andrew with the people you meet. We will provide training and transportation on all days - if you're looking for a way to make sure Andrew makes it to the White House, this is it. We'll be there every weekend day leading up to and on the day of the South Carolina primaries, so please sign up for any and all days you're available. If you are open to driving or using your car, please contact the event host - the more cars we have, the more people we can bring.<br><br>Meet at Doraville Transit Station, Lot 2 by 9:30 AM sharp. We'll canvass until sundown, then if volunteers want to, grab some dinner. We'll get back between 8:30 and 10:30 PM, depending on whether we have dinner. Obviously, a full day's commitment is a hard ask, but it's the only way we can win. Thank you all for your dedication. HUMANITY FIRST!",

We'll be able to get more materials in Vegas, though, so no worries if you don't have much. The Yang Gang will set you up!<br><br>If you're worried about talking to people, or don't know what to say, don't worry. We'll have training sessions and more experienced folks can buddy up with you if you need the help.<br><br>Plan to return Sunday night & it may take time to drop people off at their homes.<br><br>MUST RSVP TO JOIN CARPOOL, either here or on Facebook<br>Email azyanggang@gmail.com if you have questions, concerns or otherwise need direct contact",

                "Description": "### [Call for Yang TODAY!](https://www.yang2020.com/call/)<br><br>Hey Yang Gang! Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

The plan is to leave MA in the morning (8-9am) and return in the evening. Your field office destination will be determined by your departure origin and campaign's needs. Your one-way travel will be no more than 1.5 hours.<br><br>Please sign up here to get matched with a carpool. You will be matched by Sunday and Monday morning at the very latest for 2/10 and 2/11 respectively.<br><br>In order to be placed in a carpool, you MUST complete the following form here: https://tinyurl.com/GOTV-NH-carpool<br><br>An RSVP on Mobilize only could result in a missed carpool match. Any sign-ups <24 hours are not guaranteed. By requesting a carpool, you are agreeing to volunteer for the full day!",
