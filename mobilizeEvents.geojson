These are all mostly local people, of all demographics. They all gather at the starting point on their bike at the start of the event, and just hang out until it begins. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll be operating. We\u2019ll be handing out business cards and engaging in conversations if anyone is open to it.<br><br>The official time for gathering at the starting line is 6:30, the biking starts at 7:15. I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That\u2019s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)<br><br>I will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I\u2019ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!<br><br>If you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so.

Take breaks if the weather demands it. We're in the stretch run and we need to make up some serious ground. For real, it's put up or shut up time. Yang needs us now to get his delegates on the ballots or he will have no votes at the convention.<br> <br>1pm - 3 = need 2 people<br>3pm - 5 = need 1 person (I will be covering this shift)<br><br>Sign up for the event and send me a text to claim a shift. Even if you live kinda far away we need to make this happen. You will need a clip board and CD6  petition pages (slates). The PDF will be Emailed to you. I will also have blank ones at the Dupage Yang Gang meetup on Dec 18th that I can give you.

SC is the 4th state to hold a caucus or primary so it's imperative we help get Andrew Yang's message out. The science shows the best way to tell people about his message is by a face to face conversation. Join us for a fun afternoon of putting Humanity First and sharing Yang's message in Aiken county. We are meeting at the Democratic Party Headquarters at 410 Richland Ave West. Be sure to wear your Yang swag if you have some, but I have Yang buttons if you need one.",

Most people will be solid Congressional District 6 signatures. We can stand in front of the Library but we cannot gather inside the Library. 100 signatures should be a very reachable goal.<br><br>Library hours are 9am to 5pm. <br>We're looking for 2 person teams to cover 1-2 hour shifts or stay for as long as you can. . Take breaks if the weather demands it. We're in the stretch run and we need to make up some serious ground. For real, it's put up or shut up time. Yang needs us now to get his delegates on the ballots or he will have no votes at the convention.<br> <br>9am - 11 = need 2 people<br>11am - 1pm = need 2 people<br>1pm - 3 = need 2 people<br>3pm - 5 = need 1 person (I will be covering this shift)<br><br>Sign up for the event and send me a text to claim a shift. Even if you live kinda far away we need to make this happen. You will need a clip board and CD6  petition pages (slates). The PDF will be Emailed to you. I will also have blank ones at the Dupage Yang Gang meetup on Dec 18th that I can give you.<br><br>Signature Gathering info:  http://bit.ly/y2020SignatureGatheringLinks<br><br>Humanity First!",

There will likely be an after-party which we will include information to, as the venue is TBD. <br><br>As we will be on the sidewalk, we will not have access to bathroom facilities, but there are stores and restaurants w/in walking distance. Parking on lincoln is not fantastic, so I would recommend parking @ the Westchester public library, side-roads, or the Bristol Farms grocery store lots, and then walking over. <br><br>Recommended to bring: <br>- layers of clothing since it may get cooler towards the evening<br>- water or beverages to keep hydrated<br>- snacks<br>- signs, placards",

Will be on the first floor of the HSU library depending on which tables are available, preference will be in the cafe area directly across from the library entrance. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events like Arts Alive and the Farmer's Markets.<br><br>Will also discuss where to have a watch party for the next debate, assuming that the union strike is settled by then, and we know for sure when it is!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody.  Can't wait to see everyone there!",

On the call, you're able to do a few practice phone calls with an Organizer on the line to help if you get stuck. <br><br>Remember we rely on this grassroots effort that you helped create, but we can't just stop at vocalizing support.
