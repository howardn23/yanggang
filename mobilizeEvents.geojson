We'll be busy collecting signatures for the most part, but I'm planning to have down time so we can bake a Yang Gang Hang into this day! :) Let's meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!",

All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

Getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we grow and help Andrew win. The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community and talk about what drew us to the campaign. We can also talk about the ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors! This should be a really informal meeting! Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in Milwaukee as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February.",

Specifically will be dicussing getting things together to potentially do some tabling or/and yanging at Arts Alive and the Arcata Farmer's Market -both the following weekend! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

                "Description": "From the Miami Bike Scene website:<br>\u201cCritical Mass is a cycling event typically held on the last Friday of every month; its purpose is not usually formalized beyond the direct action of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets on bicycles.\u201d<br><br>For November there were HUNDREDS of cyclists in attendance. These are all mostly local people, of all demographics. They all gather at the starting point on their bike at the start of the event, and just hang out until it begins. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll be operating. We\u2019ll be handing out business cards and engaging in conversations if anyone is open to it.<br><br>The official time for gathering at the starting line is 6:30, the biking starts at 7:15. I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That\u2019s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)<br><br>I will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I\u2019ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!<br><br>If you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so. Guidelines are on the Miami Bike Scene website:<br>https://www.themiamibikescene.com/p/miami-critical-mass-guidelines.html<br><br>Starting line/Meeting spot coordinates: <br><br>25.7750256,-80.1968508<br><br>Hourly Parking near intersection of NW 2nd St and NW 1st Ave:<br><br>25.7760478,-80.194815<br><br>Where I parked last time (only $5 for whole night): <br><br>25.7760576,-80.1942459<br><br>For carpooling options email me!
