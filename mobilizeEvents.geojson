The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.<br><br>We will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls). They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Wednesday @ 5:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

We've been given a tall order - to collect a whole bunch of signatures (5000 for our Presidential candidate, 500 for each delegate!) before early February. Let's crush these goals and keep this campaign rolling. CD-2 and -3 Yangsters may also have a good amount of luck here, so please come out to support us!<br><br>This is the first day of classes in the Spring Semester at Hofstra, which has lots of local students, so I'm excited for the opportunity to collect lots of signatures.<br><br>Feel free to swing by at any time during the 8AM - 8PM window, but would really appreciate if you could spend at least ~2-3 hours helping out the campaign. We'll be busy collecting signatures for the most part, but I'm planning to have down time so we can bake a Yang Gang Hang into this day! :) Let's meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!",

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Saturday @ 6:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

During the Jan 25 event, from 9:30-3:30, approximately 100-150 high school students will be acting as the presidential candidates, moderating a mock debate, speaking with campaign volunteers, and voting in real voting booths. <br><br>The Candidate Fair (the part where Yang Gang volunteers are needed) is from  1 to 3 PM. Volunteers are welcome to attend the entire day, if they would like. <br><br>Volunteers will be sitting at a table and approached by students during the two-hour period. Two to three Yang Gang volunteers would be ideal, so please only sign up for this if you can seriously commit. JSA will provide the table; we just bring signs, information materials, handouts and sign-up sheets. <br><br>Please note that there is another tabling event on this day at the Grand Lake Farmers Market  from 9 to 2 (https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/186598/). It would be great if those who volunteer for the JSA event could pick up the materials from the farmers market table at about noon before proceeding to Jack London Square.",

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older.

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older.

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Wednesday @ 5:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Station (B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, W). With over 126,000 riders PER DAY, this station was ranked #3 for rider traffic in the entire MTA system, only behind Times Sq and Grand Central. His name is Yut Chia (brief bio: https://qns.com/\u2026/09/01/from-subway-stations-to-carnegie-h\u2026/), his passion and modern use of the violin has been proven to draw HUGE crowds everywhere he goes. <br><br>We need a strong Yang Gang force there to show everyone that Andrew Yang is a serious contender and hopefully this will draw a lot of attention for him and his policies since the media insists on blocking him out.  We will have Mr. Yang Bobblehead  in attendance to help draw a large crowd! <br><br>Please join us for this fun event, bring your signature forms, canvassing materials, and let\u2019s make it BIG!",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

I recommend wearing layers of Yang merch if you have it, hats, gloves, scarves and comfortable shoes since you may be standing outside in the shade for an unknown amount of time.  Please bring water, a KIND bar (or other snack), hand sanitizer (in case you use the porta potties), and an external battery if you're on your phone a lot.<br><br>If you are making new signs for this march, please include MLK quotes (watch https://youtu.be/FfFTLYGH9cA ) so that we are not perceived as slighting his legacy.   Signs from last year's UBI march would be appropriate.  If you are not bringing a sign, I will have business cards for distribution to MLK Birthday celebrants.",

San Antonio is home to the largest MLK March in the Nation and this year the MLK, Jr. Commission is expecting approximately 300,000 participants!<br> We'll meet at the Martin Luther King Academy for Arts Integration at 3501 Martin Luther King Dr, San Antonio, TX 78220<br><br>(This event will be updated and include more event day details as we get closer to the event)<br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. March Activities:<br><br>8:45 - 9:10 AM -- Freeman Coliseum Park and Ride to March<br>10:00 AM -- March in the 30th Annual MLK, Jr. March<br><br>We\u2019re excited and proud that Yang Gang will be part of such an incredible event like this year\u2019s MLK March.  Many of us have participated in the March before, however this year is different.  This year we will get to walk in remembrance of Dr. King, his legacy and the progress he\u2019s inspired while also walking for and representing Andew Yang, the rising Democratic Presidential Candidate and outspoken proponent of Dr. King\u2019s legacy and ideas.  This year you can join us in walking and showing support for a Presidential Candidate that is running on the ideas that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached throughout his life, including eradicating poverty, alleviating vast economic disparities in our nation and promoting the importance of the value of each individual as a human and not a number in the economy.  <br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. is an American Hero that was a champion in fighting for American Civil Rights and Equality.  He\u2019s a great leader in our history that found himself in circumstances where he can make a difference for our country, for millions of his fellow Americans and the generations to come.  He ended up dedicating his life to the opportunity of changing the status of his fellow Americans up until the day he was killed while traveling the country promoting the idea of a Universal Basic Income.  This base level income would be given to all Americans with the effect of allowing every American a meaningful chance to participate in our capitalist economy.<br><br><br>The obvious equalizing effects of a Universal Basic Income and the need to overcome historic disparities in our great nation has never gone away, and so today we are proud that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang is courageous enough to run for president on a platform of the Freedom Dividend, calling again as Dr. King did, for a Universal Basic Income for all Americans that will uplift our entire nation, but especially the impoverished, and those historically and currently left behind by our winner-take-all economy.  Andrew, who is not a career politician, has also found himself situated in a position where he is able to understand the major problems that are affecting our country and the American people, and he has chosen to act on his position and do something to help.  Andrew Yang realizes, similar to Dr. King, that he has the opportunity, and thus the responsibility to take action where he knows that he can make a major difference in the lives of millions of Americans.<br><br>We feel that Dr. King would be proud of the fight that Andrew Yang fighting and the direction he wants to take our country.<br><br>For these reasons we think it will be a great Honor to Dr. King to March for Andrew Yang with the Yang Gang in this years Martin Luther King, Jr. March in San Antonio.<br><br>We really hope you can make it!<br><br>Please contact us with any questions or concerns.<br>Thank you for your time!",

We need to spread Andrew Yang's UNIQUE message of policies driven by Humanity and backed by Data to as many South Carolina voters as possible!  With the lack of media coverage, it is up to US to get out the word. Call for an hour, an afternoon or an evening. Once you know the ropes, this can be done from the comfort of your own home or on your phone during that extra 30 minutes waiting in the school pickup line! <br>The scripts are easy and great guides and any questions can be followed up by staff.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Come join the yang gang in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as we set everyone up to phone bank and talk to Iowans through the dialer. There will be snacks and there will be a prize for the yangster that makes the most phone calls by the end of the day. Let's have fun with this and spread awareness in the early state!<br><br>Below is what we plan to do:<br>- Get Voter ID on Iowans by talking to them and asking them about Andrew Yang. The point is not to persuade someone to vote for Yang but simply plant a seed and gather information for the campaign.<br>- Get trained to phonebank if you haven\u2019t already gone through the training process. <br>- If you can, follow this step-by-step guide to get trained prior to the event: https://www.yangdaily10.com/daily-task/december-23",

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling/yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

HELP.  <br><br>Here is the Math: <br>We need 500 signatures from each of the nine Congressional Districts (CD) with a total of 4500 signatures and we are approaching the deadline of Jan. 28th.  City of Fort Wayne falls under Congressional District 3 and we have less than ~100 and still need about ~400. <br><br>We will be gathering signatures at the Women's March Fort Wayne at Allen County Court House while supporting the March as well. We will provide you with clipboards and pens, so all you have to do is show up and dress warm! If you are too shy of a person for a petition, but would like to see Andrew on the ballot, you are also more than welcome to come and just sign the petition!<br><br>So, please come out if you want to be a part of history by putting Andrew Yang on the ballot in Indiana, so that when he became the nominee, we could vote for him and turn this deep red state into a sea of blue. <br><br>Please review the guideline for signature gathering in Indiana before the event: http://bit.ly/INquickguide",

This is prime signature gathering time, and we have found it to be way better than other times/locations. <br><br>Here's a guide to gathering signatures you should look over before the event: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bnKd27uS5bEpzh8vK9vSWbj6S92aIfOHlpiOfBqAp3I/edit<br><br>We will be meeting at the corner of Dekalb Ave and Washington Park to brief everyone and go over the game plan. I will have petitions, maps, and other materials for you to carry! If you arrive late, please text/call me so we can tell you where we are, and I can get you petitions.<br><br>Please bring a clipboard and pen(s) if you have them. And dress for the weather.",

NAMM stands for National Association of Music Merchants.   If it's a music company, it's represented at the NAMM Show.  As such it attracts people in the music business from all over the country.  Musicians are a great demographic to introduce to Andrew Yang's platform, and I have no doubt will be receptive to the Freedom Dividend.  This event is not open to the public, so we won't be going inside the convention center, but trust me, all day people are walking back and forth between hotels, parking, and the convention center.  The first few hours when they open will be great time as people are outside waiting in line for registration.  Wear your Yang swag and I'll bring plenty of business cards to pass out.",

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone. We've got everything else you will need, including Andrew Yang merchandise for volunteers that help multiple times!",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.
