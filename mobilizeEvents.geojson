Yes, we need to make calls into the early states to help the teams on the ground identify voters/caucusers! <br><br>But there are other ways to help, so if phone banking is not your thing, then please come and text bank, and if that's not your thing, then please bring your writing materials and come write letters for Pen Pals for Yang. <br><br>I'm hosting at my office in Montrose, and I'll bring bagels with cream cheese and coffee to help us knock this out on a weekend morning. There is a resident office dog mascot, though he won't bother you, in case anyone has allergies. <br><br>There are so many ways to help the campaign that I'm sure we can each find something to contribute regularly together. Volunteering alone can be lonely, and I sometimes slack off, so let's do this together and motivate each other!<br><br>Prior to the event:<br><br>If phone banking, please review the handbook and get ready here: https://www.yang2020.com/call/ <br><br>If text banking, please review the handbook and get ready here: <br>https://www.yang2020.com/text/<br><br>If writing letters for Yang, please sign up and get ready here: https://penpalsforyang.com/<br><br>If you don't know how to do any of these things, your host has a slight head start, so come anyway and we can help each other.",

Our goal is to bring people together to watch the Democratic debates in a safe and friendly environment. We hope this will encourage exchange of views among undecided voters and those supporting different candidates, resulting in a better informed and active electorate. You will have the opportunity to cast a ranked choice ballot immediately following the debate, ranking your preferences among the Presidential candidates. The results of the balloting will be posted at <https://adhocdpd.weebly.com/results.html> where the results of the previous debate rankings are also posted. As in the previous eight watches we have sponsored, a moderated half-hour discussion will conclude the watch party. The debate watch is free.  Food and drink available for purchase. Doors open half-hour before start of debate.",

To help boost voter turnout and help Andrew Yang win, please reach out to friends and family, or people you Yanged and bring them to one of the early voting sites to vote, buddy system! You literally have 4 days to get friends, family, coworkers, church friends, or strangers you Yanged to vote. Better even, host a President's Date party and Yang everyone at the party and bring them to an early voting site to: vote Yang! Let\u2019s see who can bring the most people to vote for Yang!<br><br><br>Note: Make sure everyone has a valid Nevada ID. You can register as a Democrat on site if necessary. Early voting is similar to Ranked Choice Voting. You can put up to 5 candidates, of course, Andrew Yang should be the first choice if you are reading this. :) Dedicated Yang Gang should participate in the caucuses to help bring over some undecided people (don\u2019t vote early), but we still need you to get people to vote early.",

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

If you cannot participate in the caucuses for whatever reason, you can still vote for Andrew Yang at one of the early voting sites below on 2/15-2/18. An early vote counts the same as a caucus vote. To help boost voter turnout and help Andrew Yang win, please reach out to friends and family, or people you Yanged and bring them to one of the early voting sites to vote, buddy system! You literally have 4 days to get friends, family, coworkers, church friends, or strangers you Yanged to vote. Better even, host a President's Date party and Yang everyone at the party and bring them to an early voting site to: vote Yang! Let\u2019s see who can bring the most people to vote for Yang!<br><br>Note: Make sure everyone has a valid Nevada ID. You can register as a Democrat on site if necessary. Early voting is similar to Ranked Choice Voting. You can put up to 5 candidates, of course, Andrew Yang should be the first choice if you are reading this. :) Dedicated Yang Gang should participate in the caucuses to help bring over some undecided people (don\u2019t vote early), but we still need you to get people to vote early.",

It's a great problem to have, but the Yang2020 event support team is going to need your help if we want to keep up!<br><br>We're looking for volunteer moderators to edit and approve events. We're also looking for volunteer callers to contact new event hosts and prepare them for their events. If either or both of these tasks sound interesting to you, then signup and begin the on-boarding process today!",
