Could really use some company! Thank you local Yang Gang!<br><br>- Tabling is on the first floor in a central location. Ask me for location of table (exact daily location to be determined by mall management)<br>- The mall's rule on tabling is to speak when approached. Whatever it's cool, hoping to attract people to look our way and approach us, with free swag and an infectious energy<br>- Our table will be out all day long. To gauge the who and when of volunteering, I have a spreadsheet doc, please put down the time you plan to be there",

The campaign needs our help - knocking on Yang supporter doors, holding signs at polling events, helping out at field offices, and more! If you can give up a whole day from work, school, family, etc., thank you!<br><br>You're here because you're ready to head up Monday, 2/10, or Tuesday 2/11, but you need a ride or can offer one! The plan is to leave MA in the morning (8-9am) and return in the evening. Your field office destination will be determined by your departure origin and campaign's needs. Your one-way travel will be no more than 1.5 hours.<br><br>Please sign up here to get matched with a carpool. You will be matched by Sunday and Monday morning at the very latest for 2/10 and 2/11 respectively.<br><br>In order to be placed in a carpool, you MUST complete the following form here: https://tinyurl.com/GOTV-NH-carpool<br><br>An RSVP on Mobilize only could result in a missed carpool match. Any sign-ups <24 hours are not guaranteed. By requesting a carpool, you are agreeing to volunteer for the full day!",

Please let us know in the Group Discussion so we can connect you with other volunteers! <br><br>We hope to connect with the Vegas Yang Gang to see if they have places where our volunteers can stay for Saturday night. Otherwise we'll get a group AirBnB. Yes, that's right, the Action will continue through Sunday unless you can drive yourself back earlier!<br><br>Might be smart to bring sunscreen, water, sunglasses<br><br>Also bring food & drink for the trip if you want it (no long stops on our ride), $$$ for basic expenses in Las Vegas, wear your Yang Gang merch & bring as much Yang stuff as you can! We'll be able to get more materials in Vegas, though, so no worries if you don't have much. The Yang Gang will set you up!<br><br>If you're worried about talking to people, or don't know what to say, don't worry. We'll have training sessions and more experienced folks can buddy up with you if you need the help.<br><br>Plan to return Sunday night & it may take time to drop people off at their homes.",

Having conversations and passing out business cards to as many people as we can along the way.  It goes without saying that the Freedom Dividend would be a game changer in the Art Community, allowing so many the enrich their lives by creating art, opening up art spaces, teaching art, taking art lessons, and collecting art.  Now I know this is the same time as the debate - but while Yang is working his magic on the debate stage, we can be working ours by crowd yanging.  So lets record it and watch it later after an evening of talking to voters.",

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4.
