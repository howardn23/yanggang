Our goal is to bring people together to watch the Democratic debates in a safe and friendly environment. We hope this will encourage exchange of views among undecided voters and those supporting different candidates, resulting in a better informed and active electorate. You will have the opportunity to cast a ranked choice ballot immediately following the debate, ranking your preferences among the Presidential candidates. The results of the balloting will be posted at <https://adhocdpd.weebly.com/results.html> where the results of the previous debate rankings are also posted. As in the previous eight watches we have sponsored, a moderated half-hour discussion will conclude the watch party. The debate watch is free.  Food and drink available for purchase. Doors open half-hour before start of debate.",

                "Description": "This is a last ditch EPIC effort on Sunday 02/16 from 11-4 in Doylestown, PA. This is to create a lot of excitement and get a million signatures! There will be CarYanging, YangCurious Q&A, Yangaholic Testimonials and DataSharing and of course the Stop & Sign.  <br><br>Every PA Yangster is expected to sign a petition! Get a few too!<br>Every NJ Yangster is expected to sign a petition! Get a few too!<br><br>From Doylestown - People can walk the town and collect more signatures and direct people to the event.  Or people can go to NewHope/Jersey/MontCo/Delco etc and return the completed sheets back to a trusted and designated person to get them into Mariana's hands around dinner time. We ask everyone to go to www.yang2020pa.com to review the collection process and if possible, print out the relevant counties you plan on collecting signatures before the event because you can also bring your completed petition forms as well and we will get them where they need to go!<br><br>Everyone is invited. This is great if you have friends/family because there is lots to do for families around town and restaurants and bars to talk it up and get more signatures and voters!! <br><br>If you like the idea but feel it is too far - why not do one near you? We really want people to leave with canvassing in mind to continue the momentum! This is a beautiful workspace BYO  venue for food and drink and is right in the center of town. With a large TV for YangTube, a professional sound system and cobblestone driveway access to encourage walkins! Accessible by train, plane, bus, car and foot. <br><br>Free Parking. Lot's of leisurely foot traffic. <br>Museums, movie theater, shops, restaurants and close to NewHope, PA<br><br>LET'S DO THIS!!!",

If you cannot participate in the caucuses for whatever reason, you can still vote for Andrew Yang at one of the early voting sites below on 2/15-2/18. An early vote counts the same as a caucus vote. Many of our supporters may have work or family responsibilities and cannot participate in the caucuses. To help boost voter turnout and help Andrew Yang win, please reach out to friends and family, or people you Yanged and bring them to one of the early voting sites to vote, buddy system! You literally have 4 days to get friends, family, coworkers, church friends, or strangers you Yanged to vote. Better even, host a President's Date party and Yang everyone at the party and bring them to an early voting site to: vote Yang! Let\u2019s see who can bring the most people to vote for Yang! <br><br>Please sign up for the event so we can give you more assistance and directions. Please track and inform us how many people you brought out to vote and for which precinct/county timely at the close of each day so we can get a rough count of early votes each day, and plan where to send more volunteers to increase turnout the next day. Timely reporting is very important. <br><br>Voting sites and hours:<br>https://nvdems.com/early-vote/<br><br>Note: Make sure everyone has a valid Nevada ID. You can register as a Democrat on site if necessary. Early voting is similar to Ranked Choice Voting. You can put up to 5 candidates, of course, Andrew Yang should be the first choice if you are reading this. :) <br>Dedicated Yang Gang should participate in the caucuses to help bring over some undecided people (don\u2019t vote early), but we still need you to get people to vote early.",

If you cannot participate in the caucuses for whatever reason, you can still vote for Andrew Yang at one of the early voting sites below on 2/15-2/18. An early vote counts the same as a caucus vote. Many of our supporters may have work or family responsibilities and cannot participate in the caucuses. To help boost voter turnout and help Andrew Yang win, please reach out to friends and family, or people you Yanged and bring them to one of the early voting sites to vote, buddy system! You literally have 4 days to get friends, family, coworkers, church friends, or strangers you Yanged to vote. Better even, host a President's Date party and Yang everyone at the party and bring them to an early voting site to: vote Yang! Let\u2019s see who can bring the most people to vote for Yang!<br><br>Please sign up for the event so we can give you more assistance and directions. Please track and inform us how many people you brought out to vote and for which precinct/county timely at the close of each day so we can get a rough count of early votes each day, and plan where to send more volunteers to increase turnout the next day. Timely reporting is very important.<br><br>Voting sites and hours: https://nvdems.com/early-vote/<br><br>Note: Make sure everyone has a valid Nevada ID. You can register as a Democrat on site if necessary. Early voting is similar to Ranked Choice Voting. You can put up to 5 candidates, of course, Andrew Yang should be the first choice if you are reading this. :) Dedicated Yang Gang should participate in the caucuses to help bring over some undecided people (don\u2019t vote early), but we still need you to get people to vote early.",

Please let us know in the Group Discussion so we can connect you with other volunteers! <br><br>We hope to connect with the Vegas Yang Gang to see if they have places where our volunteers can stay for Saturday night.

Yes, that's right, the Action will continue through Sunday unless you can drive yourself back earlier!<br><br>Might be smart to bring sunscreen, water, sunglasses<br><br>Also bring food & drink for the trip if you want it (no long stops on our ride), $$$ for basic expenses in Las Vegas, wear your Yang Gang merch & bring as much Yang stuff as you can! We'll be able to get more materials in Vegas, though, so no worries if you don't have much. The Yang Gang will set you up!<br><br>If you're worried about talking to people, or don't know what to say, don't worry. We'll have training sessions and more experienced folks can buddy up with you if you need the help.<br><br>Plan to return Sunday night & it may take time to drop people off at their homes.<br><br>MUST RSVP TO JOIN CARPOOL, either here or on Facebook<br>Email azyanggang@gmail.com if you have questions, concerns or otherwise need direct contact",

                "Description": "### [Call for Yang TODAY!](https://www.yang2020.com/call/)<br><br>Hey Yang Gang! Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",
