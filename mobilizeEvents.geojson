After some time, they got asked to leave by security but this didn't stop them from just walking in Yang swag. The Citadel is large so we have many places to go. We can Yang cars waiting in line to get into any of the parking structures or hang at the food court or walk to the corner where the exit of the 5 fwy is and Yang the crowd. This will be a high volume day so if we get enough volunteers we can do all these spots.  Citadel attracts people from all over the country, including Hawaii so the impact will be significant. <br><br>I want to catch the morning crowd because when the citadel is at max capacity, noonish, people will not be paying attention.  They will be distracted and rushed. <br><br>All are welcomed. Newbies are encouraged. Newbie volunteers, if this is your first time and not sure how you can help. Stop by and I will take care of you. You can IG message me at  i.support.yang  Bring your Yang swag, banners, business cards, hats. If anyone has business cards they would like to donate, I will take them. or practicality anything you would like to donate or let us borrow you can drop it off and go shopping.  You can go to https://yangprints.com/ <br><br>Ho Ho Ho  let's go and win this!",

Even if you have never watched a single episode of the Simpson's, join us and become a shiny Yang Gang star just for attending.",

The goal is to show that people are supporting Andrew Yang, tell them about Andrew, and find out what issues are important to them.<br><br>Randomized field trials over the past two decades have consistently shown canvassing has the biggest impact on voter turnout, even compared to phone calls and television ads. The Yang campaign needs your help to canvass as many voters as possible!<br><br>You will be paired with an experience canvasser and given a script that tells you everything you need to say. You can talk as much or as little as you'd like. It's easy, we promise!",

We need a team of delegates in every district to find supporters and organize petition-signing events to get Andrew Yang and your district's team on the primary ballot. <br><br>No political experience is necessary, just determination to GOTB (get on the ballot) and GOTV (get out the vote) from now until the April 28 primary.  The more votes you get for Yang in your district, the better your chances of representing the great state of New York at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in July!<br><br>If you cannot be registered as a Democrat in NY by Dec. 31, 2019, you can still help as a Congressional District Lead or Event Host.<br><br>Learn more about these roles in our Zoom Webinar on Saturday, December 7, 10 am EST.  <br><br>Please use this link to find your Congressional District: <br> https://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep_house?ZIP=<br><br>Feel free to contact the host if you have any questions.",
