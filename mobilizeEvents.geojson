                "Description": "From the Miami Bike Scene website:<br>\u201cCritical Mass is a cycling event typically held on the last Friday of every month; its purpose is not usually formalized beyond the direct action of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets on bicycles.\u201d<br><br>For November there were HUNDREDS of cyclists in attendance. These are all mostly local people, of all demographics. They all gather at the starting point on their bike at the start of the event, and just hang out until it begins. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll be operating. We\u2019ll be handing out business cards and engaging in conversations if anyone is open to it.<br><br>The official time for gathering at the starting line is 6:30, the biking starts at 7:15. I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That\u2019s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)<br><br>I will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I\u2019ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!<br><br>If you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so.

We can Yang cars waiting in line to get into any of the parking structures or hang at the food court or walk to the corner where the exit of the 5 fwy is and Yang the crowd. This will be a high volume day so if we get enough volunteers we can do all these spots.  Citadel attracts people from all over the country, including Hawaii so the impact will be significant. <br><br>I want to catch the morning crowd because when the citadel is at max capacity, noonish, people will not be paying attention.  They will be distracted and rushed. <br><br>All are welcomed. Newbies are encouraged. Newbie volunteers, if this is your first time and not sure how you can help. Stop by and I will take care of you. You can IG message me at  i.support.yang  Bring your Yang swag, banners, business cards, hats. If anyone has business cards they would like to donate, I will take them. or practicality anything you would like to donate or let us borrow you can drop it off and go shopping.

The state requires 5,000 signatures for the Presidential Petition and a minimum of 500 signatures for each Congressional District delegate slate, all of which must be collected between December 31, 2019 - February 3, 2020. Due to low validity rates in the state we need to collect three times the minimum requirement.<br><br>Join Gail Mavity, Yang2020 Ballot Access Field Director, to learn how you, as a member of the New York Yang Gang, can help with this effort! Topics will include petition collector and signer requirements, petition submission, collection tips and best practices, and other information related to signature collection and ballot access in the state.<br><br>This training is not for delegate selection and will only cover ballot access. For even more information on ballot access and delegate selection, or other ways you can get involved, please join the Yang2020 volunteer Slack: https://t.co/itv8nWjuxl<br><br>A recording of the training will be posted in the #signatures_newyork Yang2020 volunteer Slack channel.",

Topics will include petition collector and signer requirements, petition submission, collection tips and best practices, and other information related to signature collection and ballot access in the state.<br><br>This training is not for delegate selection and will only cover ballot access. For even more information on ballot access and delegate selection, or other ways you can get involved, please join the Yang2020 volunteer Slack: https://t.co/itv8nWjuxl<br><br>A recording of the training will be posted in the #signatures_newyork Yang2020 volunteer Slack channel.",

We'll exit the station but stay close to Yang peoplke as they exit the station.<br>10:00am-12:30pm - We'll loop through area, wherever people are tailgating. (Come find us or text me for our exact location.)<br>12:30-onward - We'll be outside at the Coliseum BART station again to catch everyone arriving just for the game. After the the crowds subside, we'll also disband. For those who would like to continue campaigning, look for the Oakland canvassing event on Mobilze and sign up to canvass Sunday afternoon.<br><br>It's the end of an era, and Raiders fans will be out in droves. Let's Yang 'em! The Raiders vs Jaguars game starts at about 1pm, but the tailgating mayhem will start much earlier. Peak time for crowd yanging should be between 9:30am and 1:30pm.<br><br>Let's meet up on the West Oakland BART Station platform. We'll have a Yang Buck or two, a life size Andrew Yang cut-out (with an eye patch, perhaps?), and handouts. We'll head to the Coliseum together.<br><br>This won't be a tabling event at a set location. We'll need to be somewhat mobile and bring Yang to the people/party! The most important thing is to wear our Yang merch, be a fun and enthusiastic Yang Gang, and bring the movement to the Oakland community.<br><br>Sign up and get your friends to join us.

Please bring your laptop, if you have one.<br><br>We had an amazingly successful signature gathering/tabling event in downtown Frederick on First Saturday, so we're doing it again! <br><br>In order to get Andrew Yang on the primary ballot in MD we need to collect 600 signatures per district. The Frederick Yang Gang will be hosting a signature gathering and community event in Downtown Frederick on 12/14 from 2p - 5:00p.<br><br>We need your help! If you would like to help collect signatures that is FANTASTIC. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable collecting but would like to sign your name, that is AMAZING too!<br><br>If you are coming to collect signatures be sure to wear comfortable shoes, bring water and snacks. If you have a clipboard and pen, that is a bonus too!<br><br>You can find additional information about our signature gathering requirements here: http://bit.ly/MDQuick <br><br>Note: If you would like to start collecting signatures prior to the event, check out the signature guide! No need to wait for an event to get started. Farmer's markets, BMVs, movie theaters, libraries, concerts are all good options. #SecureTheBag #HumanityFirst",
