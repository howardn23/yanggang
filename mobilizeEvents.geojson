We will stand outside the Baltimore Christmas Village, and ask people for signatures to get Andrew Yang on the Maryland ballot.  Bring a clipboard and pens, and wear Yang gear.  I will also have Yang ornaments, brochures, and cards for you to hand out to those interested.<br> http://www.baltimore-christmas.com/<br>  <br>  If you are interested in caroling, comment in the section.  We can form a caroling team.  I will be playing Xmas songs at the stage of the Baltimore Christmas Village from noon to 1pm. If we get a caroling team together, I can let the Yang Caroling Team sing a few songs during my set.  Afterwards, you can walk in the crowd and ask for signatures.
