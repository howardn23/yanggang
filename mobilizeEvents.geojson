They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang. The highlight will be the Q&A discussion session afterwards, so come with questions!",

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Saturday @ 6:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

Fewer than 5 percent of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income. The way we fix it, the way we fix this, is we take Martin Luther King\u2019s message of a guaranteed minimum income: a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans.

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older.

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Wednesday @ 5:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

RSVP is not required but encouraged.<br><br>Come meet Andrew Yang! An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Volunteers are welcome to attend the entire day, if they would like. <br><br>Volunteers will be sitting at a table and approached by students during the two-hour period. Two to three Yang Gang volunteers would be ideal, so please only sign up for this if you can seriously commit. JSA will provide the table; we just bring signs, information materials, handouts and sign-up sheets. <br><br>Please note that there is another tabling event on this day at the Grand Lake Farmers Market  from 9 to 2 (https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/186598/).

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

We currently have boots on the ground canvassing in Iowa but they need our help collecting more voter data to know which houses to target.  That's why **phone banking for Iowa is the most impactful thing you can do to help Yang right now**.  Don't worry if you've never phone banked before.  It's a lot easier than you think.  The campaign is more interested in the data collection aspect rather than trying to \"convert\" a random person on the phone (of course that's nice too).

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.  <br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person. <br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone. We've got everything else you will need, including Andrew Yang merchandise for volunteers that help multiple times!",

We have less than two weeks until the Iowa Caucuses and the Yang campaign needs all the help it can get to identify/target caucus-goers to support Andrew Yang. <br><br>This means we need to make calls to (1) identify likely supporters and (2) persuade caucus-goers to support our candidate.  But the top priority is to help us identify which voters should be canvassed in-person by our Iowa volunteers.<br><br>The more calls we make, the bigger impact we will have on this election.<br><br>We will be meeting virtually via Zoom, which means you can join us from the comfort of your home to ask questions or listen to other voter calls.

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

We have only had 2-3 people active up here. If you live in NY-15, please knock on the doors of your neighbors you know to get them to sign. This has been very effective for us up here. We are trying to focus on the areas South of 167th Street and there are some key spots including Hostos Community College, Yankee Stadium area and the Courthouse where we can get some signatures. We need any help we can get especially from Spanish speakers. I am coordinating this from my home office, and we can spread out from here. I have tons of forms and just need more people to help out during the day.<br><br>I am setting this event up for all day as I will be home working all day and will be able to hit the streets and train people as needed.<br><br>Please review NY Signature Gathering Guidelines: <br><br>http://bit.ly/38OC8Ie",
