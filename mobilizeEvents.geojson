These are all mostly local people, of all demographics. They all gather at the starting point on their bike at the start of the event, and just hang out until it begins. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll be operating. We\u2019ll be handing out business cards and engaging in conversations if anyone is open to it.<br><br>The official time for gathering at the starting line is 6:30, the biking starts at 7:15. I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That\u2019s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)<br><br>I will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I\u2019ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!<br><br>If you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so.

After some time, they got asked to leave by security but this didn't stop them from just walking in Yang swag. The Citadel is large so we have many places to go. We can Yang cars waiting in line to get into any of the parking structures or hang at the food court or walk to the corner where the exit of the 5 fwy is and Yang the crowd. This will be a high volume day so if we get enough volunteers we can do all these spots.  Citadel attracts people from all over the country, including Hawaii so the impact will be significant. <br><br>I want to catch the morning crowd because when the citadel is at max capacity, noonish, people will not be paying attention.  They will be distracted and rushed. <br><br>All are welcomed. Newbies are encouraged. Newbie volunteers, if this is your first time and not sure how you can help. Stop by and I will take care of you. You can IG message me at  i.support.yang  Bring your Yang swag, banners, business cards, hats. If anyone has business cards they would like to donate, I will take them. or practicality anything you would like to donate or let us borrow you can drop it off and go shopping.

The training lasts for about an hour, just select a time slot that works best for you. On the call, you're able to do a few practice phone calls with an Organizer on the line to help if you get stuck. <br><br>Remember we rely on this grassroots effort that you helped create, but we can't just stop at vocalizing support.

We will do our best to connect with the campaign there, go knocking on doors and/or table for Yang in this important early state. After canvassing, we'll try to do a little exploring to learn about Greenville's history and culture, and probably grab some dinner at a local establishment before heading back. We'll get you there and back in a 12 hour window! <br><br>Transportation:<br>We have several designated drivers for the trip so you don't have to drive. We'll plan to pool funds to offset gas costs for the drivers, but if you can't afford it, don't let that stop you!",
