All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

These are all mostly local people, of all demographics. They all gather at the starting point on their bike at the start of the event, and just hang out until it begins. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll be operating. We\u2019ll be handing out business cards and engaging in conversations if anyone is open to it.<br><br>The official time for gathering at the starting line is 6:30, the biking starts at 7:15. I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That\u2019s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)<br><br>I will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I\u2019ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!<br><br>If you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so.

The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community and talk about what drew us to the campaign. We can also talk about the ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors! This should be a really informal meeting! Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February.",

After some time, they got asked to leave by security but this didn't stop them from just walking in Yang swag. The Citadel is large so we have many places to go. We can Yang cars waiting in line to get into any of the parking structures or hang at the food court or walk to the corner where the exit of the 5 fwy is and Yang the crowd. This will be a high volume day so if we get enough volunteers we can do all these spots.  Citadel attracts people from all over the country, including Hawaii so the impact will be significant. <br><br>I want to catch the morning crowd because when the citadel is at max capacity, noonish, people will not be paying attention.  They will be distracted and rushed. <br><br>All are welcomed. Newbies are encouraged. Newbie volunteers, if this is your first time and not sure how you can help. Stop by and I will take care of you. You can IG message me at  i.support.yang  Bring your Yang swag, banners, business cards, hats. If anyone has business cards they would like to donate, I will take them. or practicality anything you would like to donate or let us borrow you can drop it off and go shopping.  You can go to https://yangprints.com/ <br><br>Ho Ho Ho  let's go and win this!",

This is a critical time in the campaign with the NC primary fast approaching on March 3rd. <br><br>Andrew Yang isn't slowing down for the holidays and with Bloomberg already opening a campaign office in Charlotte, neither can we, but we can\u2019t distribute this many stockings alone. So how about it Yang Gang? Let\u2019s tell Bloomberg and let\u2019s tell the nation - Challenge Accepted!<br><br>If 10 people volunteer 2 hours of time each just one day this weekend, we will easily reach our goal.

We need a team of delegates in every district to collect signatures and host events to get Andrew Yang and his delegates on the primary ballot.<br><br>No political experience is necessary, just determination to GOTB (get on the ballot) and GOTV (get out the vote) from now until the April 28 primary. The more votes you get for Yang in your district, the better your chances of representing the great state of New York at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in July!<br><br>If you can't register as a Democrat in NY by Dec. 17, 2019, you can still help as a Congressional District Lead or Event Host.  Sign up for more details!<br><br>Zoom link will be emailed one day and one minute before the webinar.<br><br>Prior to attending, please:<br><br>1. Use this link to find your Congressional District: https://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep_house?ZIP=<br><br>2.
