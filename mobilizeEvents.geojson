We've been given a tall order - to collect a whole bunch of signatures (5000 for our Presidential candidate, 500 for each delegate!) before early February. Let's crush these goals and keep this campaign rolling. CD-2 and -3 Yangsters may also have a good amount of luck here, so please come out to support us!<br><br>This is the first day of classes in the Spring Semester at Hofstra, which has lots of local students, so I'm excited for the opportunity to collect lots of signatures.<br><br>Feel free to swing by at any time during the 8AM - 8PM window, but would really appreciate if you could spend at least ~2-3 hours helping out the campaign. We'll be busy collecting signatures for the most part, but I'm planning to have down time so we can bake a Yang Gang Hang into this day! :) Let's meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!",

All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

San Antonio is home to the largest MLK March in the Nation and this year the MLK, Jr. Commission is expecting approximately 300,000 participants!<br> We'll meet at the Martin Luther King Academy for Arts Integration at 3501 Martin Luther King Dr, San Antonio, TX 78220<br><br>(This event will be updated and include more event day details as we get closer to the event)<br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. March Activities:<br><br>8:45 - 9:10 AM -- Freeman Coliseum Park and Ride to March<br>10:00 AM -- March in the 30th Annual MLK, Jr. March<br><br>We\u2019re excited and proud that Yang Gang will be part of such an incredible event like this year\u2019s MLK March.  Many of us have participated in the March before, however this year is different.  This year we will get to walk in remembrance of Dr. King, his legacy and the progress he\u2019s inspired while also walking for and representing Andew Yang, the rising Democratic Presidential Candidate and outspoken proponent of Dr. King\u2019s legacy and ideas.  This year you can join us in walking and showing support for a Presidential Candidate that is running on the ideas that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached throughout his life, including eradicating poverty, alleviating vast economic disparities in our nation and promoting the importance of the value of each individual as a human and not a number in the economy.  <br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. is an American Hero that was a champion in fighting for American Civil Rights and Equality.  He\u2019s a great leader in our history that found himself in circumstances where he can make a difference for our country, for millions of his fellow Americans and the generations to come.  He ended up dedicating his life to the opportunity of changing the status of his fellow Americans up until the day he was killed while traveling the country promoting the idea of a Universal Basic Income.  This base level income would be given to all Americans with the effect of allowing every American a meaningful chance to participate in our capitalist economy.<br><br><br>The obvious equalizing effects of a Universal Basic Income and the need to overcome historic disparities in our great nation has never gone away, and so today we are proud that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang is courageous enough to run for president on a platform of the Freedom Dividend, calling again as Dr. King did, for a Universal Basic Income for all Americans that will uplift our entire nation, but especially the impoverished, and those historically and currently left behind by our winner-take-all economy.  Andrew, who is not a career politician, has also found himself situated in a position where he is able to understand the major problems that are affecting our country and the American people, and he has chosen to act on his position and do something to help.  Andrew Yang realizes, similar to Dr. King, that he has the opportunity, and thus the responsibility to take action where he knows that he can make a major difference in the lives of millions of Americans.<br><br>We feel that Dr. King would be proud of the fight that Andrew Yang fighting and the direction he wants to take our country.<br><br>For these reasons we think it will be a great Honor to Dr. King to March for Andrew Yang with the Yang Gang in this years Martin Luther King, Jr. March in San Antonio.<br><br>We really hope you can make it!<br><br>Please contact us with any questions or concerns.<br>Thank you for your time!",

The purpose of this meeting is to get to know other Yang supporters in our state and talk about what drew us to the campaign. We will also discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors! This will be a really informal meeting and no prior campaigning experience is required!  We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in more communities across Tennessee as we approach the Democratic primary on March 3.",

It is vital to have slack on your laptop for phone banking and text banking. But the setup process can be somewhat confusing. We can walk you through how to do this, so you can text bank or phone bank in early states whenever is most convenient for you. <br><br>MiniVAN is the smartphone app we use for canvassing. It is available on iPhone and Android - feel free to download it before you arrive. We can go over how to use the app and how to get going with canvassing in your neighborhood.

We will have CAKE and PRIZES for everyone who comes AND a surprise gift for the Candidate that only those attending will be in on.....  <br>Target time for surprise is 6:30. Feel free to bring kids if you need to. We have a few things to keep them entertained.<br><br>Here are the details:<br>*Register! Come for 1 hour, 4 hours or anything in between!<br>*First timers are welcome, and training is provided.  We have scripts to follow and it is a lot easier than you think! <br>*Bring your smartphone & laptop. Earbuds or earphones are helpful.   We do have a few phones & computers to loan if you cannot bring yours. <br>*Cake. Did I mention cake??*<br>*What is a party without decorations?? I will have chalk markers on hand to Yang the windows of our cars too! We can create moving advertisements for Yang 2020. (they stay on in the rain but do come off easily with a damp cloth!)<br>*After you register, you will receive several things;  a link to the online Yang 2020 Volunteer Code of Conduct, instructions to both download the minivan app to your smartphone and to create an action id. If you have already done this, no need to do it again! If you wish, we can do those together when you arrive.<br><br>Again, the time is from 4-7:30 and you are welcome to arrive at any time in that window. Sign-up times are to give us an idea of when volunteers will be arriving. Call me if you have any questions!",

We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/)<br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer will be open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 2:00PM CT - 6:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!",

Given his limited exposure, his performance blows away the competition. This Saturday, lets take to doors in Kalamazoo to increase his exposure!<br><br>We're planning to go out in groups and knock doors with fliers, business cards, or whatever we can get our hands on.  Feel free to bring your own materials.  I'm talking with our new Yang Gang Regional Organizer Jeffrey Wrisley about getting official materials and official door-knocking lists.<br><br>We'll convene at noon and head out to the streets around 12:30. <br><br>Future events may include overpassbanking or holding up signs in well-trafficked areas. Boots-on-the-ground enthusiasm for Yang is the most powerful way to turn heads and show our fellow citizens we have the energy to take the White House.",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/)<br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer will be open from 11:00AM CT to 9:00PM CT. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 2:00PM CT - 6:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!",

Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/)<br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer will be open from 11:00AM CT to 9:00PM CT. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 2:00PM CT - 6:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4.

Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/)<br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer will be open from 11:00AM CT to 9:00PM CT. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 2:00PM CT - 6:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4.

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>On January 3-6, Andrew Yang will tour the Hawkeye state to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.<br><br>To talk with Andrew about his bold plans for Iowa and the nation, join him at one of his events in Perry, Knoxville, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mt. Pleasant, Wapello, Burlington, Fairfield, Washington, Fort Madison, Keokuk, Muscatine, Davenport, Clinton, Tipton, and Monticello.",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.<br><br>On January 3-6, Andrew Yang will tour the Hawkeye state to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.<br><br>To talk with Andrew about his bold plans for Iowa and the nation, join him at one of his events in Perry, Knoxville, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mt. Pleasant, Wapello, Burlington, Fairfield, Washington, Fort Madison, Keokuk, Muscatine, Davenport, Clinton, Tipton, and Monticello.",

An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.<br><br>On January 3-6, Andrew Yang will tour the Hawkeye state to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.<br><br>To talk with Andrew about his bold plans for Iowa and the nation, join him at one of his events in Perry, Knoxville, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mt.
