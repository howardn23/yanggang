During the Jan 25 event, from 9:30-3:30, approximately 100-150 high school students will be acting as the presidential candidates, moderating a mock debate, speaking with campaign volunteers, and voting in real voting booths. <br><br>The Candidate Fair (the part where Yang Gang volunteers are needed) is from  1 to 3 PM. Volunteers are welcome to attend the entire day, if they would like. <br><br>Volunteers will be sitting at a table and approached by students during the two-hour period. Two to three Yang Gang volunteers would be ideal, so please only sign up for this if you can seriously commit. JSA will provide the table; we just bring signs, information materials, handouts and sign-up sheets. <br><br>Please note that there is another tabling event on this day at the Grand Lake Farmers Market  from 9 to 2 (https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/186598/). It would be great if those who volunteer for the JSA event could pick up the materials from the farmers market table at about noon before proceeding to Jack London Square.",

All are welcome. <br><br>[From Wiki] <br>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? is a 1967 book by African-American minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and social justice campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr. Advocating for human rights and a sense of hope, it was King's fourth and last book before his assassination. He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.",

Please bring water, a KIND bar (or other snack), hand sanitizer (in case you use the porta potties), and an external battery if you're on your phone a lot.<br><br>If you are making new signs for this march, please include MLK quotes (watch https://youtu.be/FfFTLYGH9cA ) so that we are not perceived as slighting his legacy.

San Antonio is home to the largest MLK March in the Nation and this year the MLK, Jr. Commission is expecting approximately 300,000 participants!<br> We'll meet at the Martin Luther King Academy for Arts Integration at 3501 Martin Luther King Dr, San Antonio, TX 78220<br><br>(This event will be updated and include more event day details as we get closer to the event)<br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. March Activities:<br><br>8:45 - 9:10 AM -- Freeman Coliseum Park and Ride to March<br>10:00 AM -- March in the 30th Annual MLK, Jr. March<br><br>We\u2019re excited and proud that Yang Gang will be part of such an incredible event like this year\u2019s MLK March.  Many of us have participated in the March before, however this year is different.  This year we will get to walk in remembrance of Dr. King, his legacy and the progress he\u2019s inspired while also walking for and representing Andew Yang, the rising Democratic Presidential Candidate and outspoken proponent of Dr. King\u2019s legacy and ideas.  This year you can join us in walking and showing support for a Presidential Candidate that is running on the ideas that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached throughout his life, including eradicating poverty, alleviating vast economic disparities in our nation and promoting the importance of the value of each individual as a human and not a number in the economy.  <br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. is an American Hero that was a champion in fighting for American Civil Rights and Equality.  He\u2019s a great leader in our history that found himself in circumstances where he can make a difference for our country, for millions of his fellow Americans and the generations to come.  He ended up dedicating his life to the opportunity of changing the status of his fellow Americans up until the day he was killed while traveling the country promoting the idea of a Universal Basic Income.  This base level income would be given to all Americans with the effect of allowing every American a meaningful chance to participate in our capitalist economy.<br><br><br>The obvious equalizing effects of a Universal Basic Income and the need to overcome historic disparities in our great nation has never gone away, and so today we are proud that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang is courageous enough to run for president on a platform of the Freedom Dividend, calling again as Dr. King did, for a Universal Basic Income for all Americans that will uplift our entire nation, but especially the impoverished, and those historically and currently left behind by our winner-take-all economy.  Andrew, who is not a career politician, has also found himself situated in a position where he is able to understand the major problems that are affecting our country and the American people, and he has chosen to act on his position and do something to help.  Andrew Yang realizes, similar to Dr. King, that he has the opportunity, and thus the responsibility to take action where he knows that he can make a major difference in the lives of millions of Americans.<br><br>We feel that Dr. King would be proud of the fight that Andrew Yang fighting and the direction he wants to take our country.<br><br>For these reasons we think it will be a great Honor to Dr. King to March for Andrew Yang with the Yang Gang in this years Martin Luther King, Jr. March in San Antonio.<br><br>We really hope you can make it!<br><br>Please contact us with any questions or concerns.<br>Thank you for your time!",

Could really use some company! Thank you local Yang Gang!<br><br>- Tabling is on the first floor in a central location. Ask me for location of table (exact daily location to be determined by mall management)<br><br>- The mall's rule on tabling is to speak when approached. Whatever it's cool, hoping to attract people to look our way and approach us, with free swag and an infectious energy<br><br>- Our table will be out all day long. To gauge the who and when of volunteering, I have a spreadsheet doc, please put down the time you plan to be there",

Ask me for location of table (exact daily location to be determined by mall management)<br><br>- The mall's rule on tabling is to speak when approached.  Whatever it's cool, my hope is we lure people in looking our way and approaching us, with free swag and an infectious energy<br><br>- Our table will be out all day long.  To gauge the who and when of volunteering, I have a spreadsheet doc, please put down the time you plan to be there.",

All are welcome, but we're doing this for people who live far away from the established Yang Gangs in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, and Memphis or are unable to easily connect with them.<br><br>Getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we grow and help Andrew win. The purpose of this meeting is to get to know other Yang supporters in our state and talk about what drew us to the campaign. We will also discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors! This will be a really informal meeting and no prior campaigning experience is required!  We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in more communities across Tennessee as we approach the Democratic primary on March 3.",

Please bring your laptops and smartphones. <br><br>Slack is how Yang Gang volunteers stay in communication across California and across the nation. It is vital to have slack on your laptop for phone banking and text banking. But the setup process can be somewhat confusing. We can walk you through how to do this, so you can text bank or phone bank in early states whenever is most convenient for you. <br><br>MiniVAN is the smartphone app we use for canvassing. It is available on iPhone and Android - feel free to download it before you arrive. We can go over how to use the app and how to get going with canvassing in your neighborhood. Quality face-to-face interactions are the BEST way to get Andrew's message out and get new people into the Yang Gang.",

For Andrew Yang's 45th birthday, we are going to surprise our 46th President on this day that is ONLY 47 days from the SC Primary!!  <br><br>Today, Greater Columbia is going to give him one heck of a gift by doing a massive phone-banking celebration with the goal of surprising him with an overwhelming NUMBER of calls that we will gather DATA from so that we can figure out the MATH needed to earn him as many delegates as possible in the primary, which is only 47 days away.  <br><br>We will have CAKE and PRIZES for everyone who comes <br>If we have a large enough group to be impactful, we can go onto FB live and other social media and sing Happy Birthday to the candidate. We will aim to do this between  6:15- 6:30. <br><br>Feel free to bring kids if you need to. We have a few things to keep them entertained.<br><br>Here are the details:<br>*Register! Come for 1 hour, 4 hours or anything in between!<br>*First timers are welcome, and training is provided.  We have scripts to follow and it is a lot easier than you think! <br>*Bring your smartphone & laptop. Earbuds or earphones are helpful.   We do have a few phones & computers to loan if you cannot bring yours. <br>*Cake. Did I mention cake??*<br>*What is a party without decorations?? I will have chalk markers on hand to Yang the windows of our cars too! We can create moving advertisements for Yang 2020. (they stay on in the rain but do come off easily with a damp cloth!)<br>*After you register, you will receive several things;  a link to the online Yang 2020 Volunteer Code of Conduct, instructions to both download the minivan app to your smartphone and to create an action id. If you have already done this, no need to do it again! If you wish, we can do those together when you arrive.<br><br>Again, the time is from 4-7:30 and you are welcome to arrive at any time in that window. Sign-up times are to give us an idea of when volunteers will be arriving. Call me if you have any questions!",

Specifically will be discussing getting things together to potentially do some tabling or/and yanging at Arts Alive and the Arcata Farmer's Market -both the following weekend! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

This will be a learning experience for us as it is our first attempt at crowdyanging a sports crowd. <br><br>The focus is to better understand the logistics and dynamics for Yanging at a Rockets game, while also generating interest with fans, pedestrians and event staff alike! This event will set the pace for a big game against a western conference rival, the #1 seeded LA Lakers on January 18th. That\u2019ll be a sellout game, so let\u2019s get some experience first :) reach out to me if you\u2019d like to carpool or  have any questions or ideas. Remember to bring water! <br><br>We will meet outside the Toyota Center 1 hour prior to the game starting. Let\u2019s meet at the intersection of La Branch St x Clay St with the outdoor basketball courts as a landmark.<br> <br> Some MATH: Average attendance is 18,055 out of max capacity of 18,300. So even  if just 50% attended, that\u2019d be 9k!!",

                "Description": "### [Call for Yang TODAY!](https://www.yang2020.com/call/)<br><br>Hey Yang Gang! Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

                "Description": "Hey Yang Gang! Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/)<br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer will be open from 11:00AM CT to 9:00PM CT. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 2:00PM CT - 6:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone. We've got everything else you will need, including Andrew Yang merchandise for volunteers that help multiple times!",
