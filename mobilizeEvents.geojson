Please let us know in the Group Discussion so we can connect you with other volunteers! <br><br>We hope to connect with the Vegas Yang Gang to see if they have places where our volunteers can stay for Saturday night. Otherwise we'll get a group AirBnB. Yes, that's right, the Action will continue through Sunday unless you can drive yourself back earlier!<br><br>Might be smart to bring sunscreen, water, sunglasses<br><br>Also bring food & drink for the trip if you want it (no long stops on our ride), $$$ for basic expenses in Las Vegas, wear your Yang Gang merch & bring as much Yang stuff as you can! We'll be able to get more materials in Vegas, though, so no worries if you don't have much. The Yang Gang will set you up!<br><br>If you're worried about talking to people, or don't know what to say, don't worry. We'll have training sessions and more experienced folks can buddy up with you if you need the help.<br><br>Plan to return Sunday night & it may take time to drop people off at their homes.<br><br>MUST RSVP TO JOIN CARPOOL, either here or on Facebook<br>Email azyanggang@gmail.com if you have questions, concerns or otherwise need direct contact",

We'll tell people about debate watch parties and sign people up to the San Francisco Yang Gang.<br><br>This event doesn't require a lot of manpower (my wife and I will hold it down), but come stop by and hang out and sip on some boba. We will also have posters to walk down Balboa and hand out to businesses to put on their storefront windows. We can also set up a secondary table down the street if more people show!",

Local experts on Nuclear energy  want to help share their knowledge and excited that Andrew has included this piece in the climate change discussion.<br><br>Come have a discussion about the prospects of atomic energy as a tool to help mitigate climate change. The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.<br><br>We will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls). They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang. The highlight will be the Q&A discussion session afterwards, so come with questions!",

                "Description": "### [Call for Yang TODAY!](https://www.yang2020.com/call/)<br><br>Hey Yang Gang! Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",
