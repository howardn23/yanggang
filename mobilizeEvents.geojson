Local experts on Nuclear energy  want to help share their knowledge and excited that Andrew has included this piece in the climate change discussion.<br><br>Come have a discussion about the prospects of atomic energy as a tool to help mitigate climate change. The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.<br><br>We will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls). They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang. The highlight will be the Q&A discussion session afterwards, so come with questions!",

Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

Fewer than 5 percent of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income. The way we fix it, the way we fix this, is we take Martin Luther King\u2019s message of a guaranteed minimum income: a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

CD-2 and -3 Yangsters may also have a good amount of luck here, so please come out to support us!<br><br>This is the first day of classes in the Spring Semester at Hofstra, which has lots of local students, so I'm excited for the opportunity to collect lots of signatures.<br><br>Feel free to swing by at any time during the 8AM - 8PM window, but would really appreciate if you could spend at least ~2-3 hours helping out the campaign. We'll be busy collecting signatures for the most part, but I'm planning to have down time so we can bake a Yang Gang Hang into this day! :) Let's meet some local Yang Gang members, Yang some Long Islanders (super important, because we need more than 15% of votes for a Congressional District to secure DNC delegates), and help Make America Think Harder!",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Come join the yang gang as we set everyone up to phone bank and talk to Iowans through the dialer. There will be snacks and there will be a prize for the yangster that makes the most phone calls by the end of the day. Let's have fun with this and spread awareness in the early state!<br><br>Below is what we plan to do:<br>- Get Voter ID on Iowans by talking to them and asking them about Andrew Yang. The point is not to persuade someone to vote for Yang but simply plant a seed and gather information for the campaign.<br>- Get trained to phonebank if you haven\u2019t already gone through the training process. <br>- If you can, follow this step-by-step guide to get trained prior to the event: https://www.yangdaily10.com/daily-task/december-23",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

The cafe is usually quiet at this time, and sparsely populated.

                "Description": "Thanks for signing up to attend the Humboldt County Yang Gang Hang!<br><br>This will be a casual meetup at the Ramones in Wildberries (the sun room) on every Wednesday @ 5:30pm to discuss how to get involved with the campaign and plan for the coming weeks. Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Station (B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, W). With over 126,000 riders PER DAY, this station was ranked #3 for rider traffic in the entire MTA system, only behind Times Sq and Grand Central. His name is Yut Chia (brief bio: https://qns.com/\u2026/09/01/from-subway-stations-to-carnegie-h\u2026/), his passion and modern use of the violin has been proven to draw HUGE crowds everywhere he goes. <br><br>We need a strong Yang Gang force there to show everyone that Andrew Yang is a serious contender and hopefully this will draw a lot of attention for him and his policies since the media insists on blocking him out.  We will have Mr. Yang Bobblehead  in attendance to help draw a large crowd! <br><br>Please join us for this fun event, bring your signature forms, canvassing materials, and let\u2019s make it BIG!",

We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.<br><br>Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!<br><br>![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)",

Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone. We've got everything else you will need, including Andrew Yang merchandise for volunteers that help multiple times!",

So let\u2019s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.<br><br>Every day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew\u2019s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.<br><br>If you\u2019ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang\u2019s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew\u2019s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.<br><br>Please join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.<br><br>Note: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone. We've got everything else you will need, including Andrew Yang merchandise for volunteers that help multiple times!",

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",
