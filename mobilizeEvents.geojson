Ask me for location of table (exact daily location to be determined by mall management)<br>- The mall's rule on tabling is to speak when approached. Whatever it's cool, hoping to attract people to look our way and approach us, with free swag and an infectious energy<br>- Our table will be out all day long. To gauge the who and when of volunteering, I have a spreadsheet doc, please put down the time you plan to be there",

Local experts on Nuclear energy  want to help share their knowledge and excited that Andrew has included this piece in the climate change discussion.<br><br>Come have a discussion about the prospects of atomic energy as a tool to help mitigate climate change. The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.<br><br>We will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls). They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang. The highlight will be the Q&A discussion session afterwards, so come with questions!",

(Signup to get address and contact details via email.)<br><br>Afterward, we'll gather at the South Hill Starbuck's on 29th at 3PM to unwind and meet new Yang Gang at our weekly Yang Gang Hang.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!<br><br>Connecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!<br><br>This is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don\u2019t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.<br><br>This will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!<br><br>And really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody. Can't wait to see everyone there!",

As name recognition continues to go up and up for Yang, the need also increases to go beyond that and help people connect that name to the policies and Humanity First philosophy that are our reasons for supporting him in the first place! <br><br>So come on down to help connect interested community members with other Yang supporters, show how they can help too, share with the Yang-curious why you support Yang over the crowd of other candidates, and help spread that correct information over mis-information (make America think harder)! At the very least get your picture taken with our giant 6ft Yangbuck!<br><br>This is our opportunity to have face-to-face conversations with the community-at-large, grow our grassroots base, and make lasting impressions that are far more impactful and lasting than the mere sharing of talking points!<br><br>Email to designate a specific time slot, or just come on down and give moral support on your break -the more the merrier! <br><br>Chairs, table, and logistics are all taken care of, but what we are always in need of are more materials (Prints: infographics, cards,  posters), let us know what you can contribute  by email or call,  or/and drop off your favorite material from yangprints.com or elsewhere. (For this, we specifically would love material that is geared towards the artist community and it's supporters! For example: https://yangprints.com/tags/arts & https://yangprints.com/tags/artists) And, if you simply want to help but don't know specifically how, simply contact us and we'll move you forward!<br><br>Hope to see you there,<br>-Humanity First!",

Parking is available at the parking garage at 9th and Locust. It is $1 per hour. <br><br>Doors open at 7:00pm. RSVP is not required but encouraged. <br><br>Come meet Andrew Yang! An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Thus let's get things started!<br><br>Please feel free to bring any other yang related materials to share or to give to others to work on (some of us have button makers, can chop prints which saves money on copy centers...).<br><br>And of course bring that positive Humanity First attitude!<br><br>(For any questions/problems please call (760) 793-0509 )",

Time has flown by, and we need to make a final push to make sure as many Iowans as possible turn out for our candidate. Phone banking is the most impactful thing we can do to help in Iowa right now, short of flying out there ourselves. It's easy, there's a script, and we can walk you through the process. All you need is a laptop or tablet with a speaker and a pair of headphones. <br><br>Canvassing: The data shows door-knocking is HIGHLY effective. We've been canvassing the last few months with great results. For those who haven't canvassed before, we can train you and send you out with a partner who knows the drill.  All materials will be provided. There is a script you can use, too! <br><br>Light snacks will be provided. Please be aware there may be a (friendly) dog present at the volunteer's house.",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Fewer than 5 percent of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income. The way we fix it, the way we fix this, is we take Martin Luther King\u2019s message of a guaranteed minimum income: a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans.

Thank you local Yang Gang!<br><br>The flea market is where the Deanza college open parking lot is. The booth we rent is #12.   If you come from Flint Center side, it'll be the 1st booth at the 2nd row near the food court where food trucks will be set up by the event.<br><br>The event will be between 8am and 4pm on Feb 2nd (Saturday).  I would like to have 1 or 2 person to help me set up between 7 - 7:30, after that cars are not allowed in the area.<br><br>You may come to help at any section of the day and for how ever long you can stay.  Our goal is to get more people pay attention to Andrew Yang and his message, and hopefully can get out and vote for him on March 3rd.<br><br>Local yang gangs have prepared enough print outs and signs for the event.  We just need to prepare more yang buttons.  So please look out for Yang button making party some time early next week. <br><br>Let's do it together.  Yang more people and meet local yang gangs.   Let California be another winning state for Yang!",

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work.

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older.

And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). <br><br>2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.<br><br>4.

RSVP is not required but encouraged.<br><br>Come meet Andrew Yang! An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.<br><br>Andrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.<br><br>Andrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve\u2014one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.",

My apartment is in the heart of the district right next to the 167th Street B/D stop. We get plenty of commuters going into Manhattan from 7-10 AM and then lots of people coming home from 4-8 PM uptown. We are also deploying signature collectors at Hostos Community College and Bronx Community College, which are both in our district. We are trying to get at least 2 people and no more than 4 to be in a group to collect signatures together. I have plenty of extra forms. If you have a clipboard and pen, please bring them with you.  If you are a CUNY student, your presence is helpful for access to Hostos and BCC. I am generally available all day to manage petition distribution and receipt. Please just let me know in advance when you plan to come so I can match you with another volunteer.",
